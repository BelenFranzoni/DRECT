## Requirements

- Python 3.9.12
- matplotlib == 3.5.2
- scikit_learn == 1.0.2
- torch == 1.11.0+cu113
- numpy == 1.22.3
- pytorch-lightning == 1.5.10

Dependencies can be installed using the following command:
```bash
pip3 install torch==1.11.0 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Reproducibility

#### Test

- Test.ipynb 
(Using MATLAB to plot the last resultï¼Œthe display code for the comparative results of the paper can be found at "DRECT/MATLAB/Result/Results_Graph_Paper.mlx". To facilitate user convenience and verification, an example of how to draw your results graph is available at "DRECT/MATLAB/Result/Results_Graph.m".It is worth noting that you can achieve optimal display results by adjusting the contour_level parameter or by adjusting the parameters in preprocessing for better model output)

#### Train

```shell
# For T1T2
python3 main.py --Type T1T2

# For DOSY
python3 main.py --Type DOSY

# For VD
python3 main.py --Type VD
```

## Pre-trained models
Something wrong with git-lfs, you can get the pre-trained models on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B-OZLdKW9k4eDrqzUU9UySQUqVvSripd) instead.

## Others
Raw data for VD available at DOI: 10.15127/1.303820.(https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/uk-ac-man-scw:303820
), It needs to be processed by DOSYToolbox and our preprocessing module(MATLAB/Data/VD/Solve_data.m) after downloading.
